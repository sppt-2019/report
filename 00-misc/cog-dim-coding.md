# Cognitive Dimensions Coding
## Not programming, but coding of statements
---

In the social sciences the term coding means roughly the same as tagging or annotating some material, typically interview transcriptions. In this file coding is used as the social science term. Statements are sentences, or time stamps, in the transcribed material that signify an instance where something relevant occurs.
