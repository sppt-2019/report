\section{Foreword}
The field of game development is subject to many opinions from the industry and often little scientific evidence. We will therefore need to cite pages that are not \dquote{traditionally scientific} in this report, examples of which are Quora and StackOverflow. These sources are of questionable quality and need not reflect the broad opinion on the game development industry. However, we include them here to indicate that \dquote{some} game developers share that belief.
