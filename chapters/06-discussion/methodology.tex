\section{Methodology}
In this section we will discuss the chosen methodology for this project. A number of different methodologies where presented in \secref{prog-usability}, of these we opted for \champagne. None of the methodologies where exact matches for our case, therefore we modified \champagne somewhat to fit our case better. This modification consisted of including additional \attentions and \cognitive usability methodologies.
