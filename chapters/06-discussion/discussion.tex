\chapter{Discussion}
In this chapter we discuss the results of the project. We start with a discussion of the adopting potential of F\# and examine the test participants' arguments for and against F\#. We then move on to discussion the methodology adopted in this project, namely the use of \champagne, \attention and \cognitive. Finally we discuss the choice of the Unity game engine as host for this experiment and outline other viable alternatives.
