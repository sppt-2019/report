\chapter{Discussion}
In this chapter we discuss the results of the project. We start with a discussion of the adoption potential of F\# and examine the test participants' arguments for and against F\#. We then move on to discussing the methodology adopted in this project, namely the use of \champagne, \attention and \cognitive. Finally we discuss the technology choices we did in the project, which consists of using Unity as host game engine and C\# and F\# as languages.
