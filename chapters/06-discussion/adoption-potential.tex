\section{F\# Adoption Potential}
While \fs code produced during the user test, was in general shorter than the \cs code (see \appref{terse-diff-comp}), the participants expressed that they would not personally choose \fs in a real project. Even participants who clearly identified these benefits of \fs, held this opinion. In this we will explore the stated reasons for this standpoint. The participants stated a number of rationals for this during the debriefing interview, which have been categorised below. Each category is, in turn, analysed and explained.

\subsection{Prevalence and Popularity of C\#}
Several participants stated that \cs was simply more prevalent, therefore additional documentation, forum posts, tools and libraries would be available. These are very important because they aid developer productivity, which is of utmost importance in game development.
