\section{Performance Benchmarking the FRP System}
In this chapter we examine the performance of F\# and our \gls{FRP} system in Unity. We first examine the aspect of \gls{GC} by looking at Unity best-practice guidelines, which suggests that garbage is to be avoided to the extent that it's possible. We were not aware of this when we implemented reference solutions to the eight usability test cases that we presented in \secref{usability:test:cases}. We therefore adapt one of the solutions to conform to Unity best-practice guidelines and benchmark that against a more \dquote{careless} implementation.
