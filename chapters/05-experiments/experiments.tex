\chapter{Concurrency and Programming in C\# and F\#}
As part of researching whether or not functional programming in F\# is suitable for Unity game development we conducted a series of experiments. We first and foremost research whether the lenient evaluation strategy provides the high implicit parallelisability that was promised in \cite{DBLP:journals/cl/Tremblay-parallel}. During this research we found that there is a certain threshold of task-sizes, which must be exceeded before parallelisation has a positive effect on execution time. We attempt to estimate this threshold in \secref{crit:work} using two tests; a busy-wait delay estimation and matrix summation.

As part of the prototype for the usability test in the previous section we developed a simple \gls{FRP} system in F\#. In the final section of this chapter we measure the performance of said system to ascertain whether or not the use of functional programming in Unity results in a performance penalty.
