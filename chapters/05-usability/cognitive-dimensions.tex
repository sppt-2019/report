\subsubsection{Cognitive Dimensions}
In this experiment we first and foremost wish to test how well-suited \fsh is in the context of game development. In the side-by-side cognitive dimensions analysis we compare the participants' solutions in \fsh with those in \csh, as they were given test cases from the same category. This allow us to use a well-established vocabulary to discuss whether or not functional programming is suitable for game development.

% Do we need this table? It is part of the Champagne testing, but not really related to side-by-side analysis
