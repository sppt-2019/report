\subsubsection{Secondary Notation}
In the test we saw very limited use of secondary notation. This is likely caused by the relatively small tasks, along with the fact that the code was not meant to be used in production nor expanded upon. The programmers, however, would often open said pop-up boxes to read about the functions and methods before putting them to use. Generally, our intuition was that the programmers found it more easy to understand the C\# documentation than the F\# documentation. We suspect that there two reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The programmers were more experienced in C\#.
    \item F\# uses the arrow function signatures (e.g. \mintinline{fsharp}|val map : mapping : ('T -> 'U) -> list:'T list -> 'U list|, which is the signature of \ttt{List.map}) in its documentation. This notation indicates that a function of multiple parameters can be curried. Curring is not supported in C\# and is thus a concept that the programmers were unfamiliar with.
\end{enumerate}
