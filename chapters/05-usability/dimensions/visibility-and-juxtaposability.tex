\subsubsection{Visibility and Juxtaposability}
All the participants in the tests chose to use Visual Studio, which was used for both C\# and F\#. The differences in this dimension are thus minimal. It is interesting, however, that none of the visibility and juxtaposability enchancing features of the \gls{IDE} were used during the tests. This may have two possible explanations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The tests were relatively small-scale and required minimal interaction with existing code.
    \item When existing code was needed, the participants would refer to the cheat-sheet or task descriptions, where example code was given. Some participants actually chose to open those documents side-by-side with Visual Studio.
\end{enumerate}
