\section{Analysis}
This section analyses the data presentation in \secref{test-results}, using methodology presented in \secref{prog-usability}. In order to gauge the difficulty of using F\# in comparison to C\# we use the cognitive dimensions framework and the attention investment model. These methodologies are used to estimate the ease-of-use of both programming languages, we call this metric writability. Furthermore, the cognitive dimensions framework can be utilised to estimate the readability or maintainability of the code written during the test.

\subsection{Syntax Comparison}
Test participants encountered problems with various aspects of F\#'s syntax. Such issues are to be expected when developing in a new programming language, furthermore, syntactical errors are not the main focus of this inquiry. Therefore these issues are discussed in this section.

\subsubsection{Bindings and Operators}
In F\# the \ttt{=} symbol is used to denote two different operators; the value-binding operator, and the equality operator. Notably the symbol is not used for rebinding, F\# equivalent of assignments which it is in C\#. A comparison of the two different rebinding/assignment styles can be seen in \lstref{ass-comp}. Rebindings are only allowed on \ttt{mutable} variables, which should be limited to a scope.

\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
\begin{minted}{fsharp}
let mutable x = 0
x <- 1
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
\begin{minted}{csharp}
int x = 0;
x = 1;
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Assignment Comparison}

\end{listing}

Furthermore, since \ttt{x = 1} is valid F\#, no errors where encountered immediately. Instead the program behaved unexpectedly and they received a warning, that the value of a boolean expression was being ignored. None of the participants where able to deduce the source of the error without assistance from the monitor. The degree of assistance required ranged from a hint to the monitor explaining the problem so that the test could continue.

Some participants encountered minor errors when declaring variables, because variables are implicitly immutable in F\#. This is the opposite of C\#, where the \ttt{const} keyword is used to explicitly declare a variable immutable. However, once the participants realised this, they had no issue using it.
