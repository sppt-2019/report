\section{Analysis}
This section analyses the data presentation in \secref{test-results}, using methodology presented in \secref{prog-usability}. In order to gauge the difficulty of using F\# in comparison to C\# we use the cognitive dimensions framework and the attention investment model. These methodologies are used to estimate the ease-of-use of both programming languages, we call this metric writability. Furthermore, the cognitive dimensions framework can be utilised to estimate the readability or maintainability of the code written during the test.
