\chapter{User Test}
In this chapter we research usability of functional-style programming in game engines. The tests are formulated based on the Champagne Prototyping methodology (see \secref{champagne}). For this test the Unity game engine was extended, via a plugin to support programming in F\#\cite{fsharp2019plugin}. In addition, a \gls{FRP} module was implemented in F\# for Unity, these two extensions served as the prototype under test. The test cases in the following section were formulated as the experimental tasks. Finally a number of domain experts, in this case experienced Unity developers, were selected as participants. 

The usability test was intended to examine the viability of using functional programming in commercial game engines. Again, we draw on the approaches presented by the game development gurus; Carmack and Sweeney. Carmack's opinion of using functional-style programming whenver convenient is represented by C\#, which has many functional-style constructs. Sweeney's opinion of a pure functional language with explicit effects typing constructs is (somewhat) represented by F\#. F\# is pure by default, but it has the \ttt{mutable} keyword, which allows the programmer to declare mutable variables. These variables are overridden using the \ttt{\textless-} operator, which requires the programmer to explicitly indicate a non-pure action.
