\section{Problem Statement} \label{sec:problem_statement}
The gurus John Carmack and Tim Sweeney present two different approaches to the use of functional programming in game development. On one hand Carmack recommends writing code in a functional style whenever possible, but he does not believe fully functional programming languages are practical tools for game development. The main features mentioned are higher-order and pure functions along with action items.

In contrast Sweeney argues for a pure functional language supporting multiple evaluation strategies explicitly controlled by the programmer. In addition, he argues for constructs that allow for explicit handling of the imperative nature of games, however the exact nature of such constructs is left to the language designers.

Using the .NET platform we can conduct a side-by-side evaluation of functional and object-oriented programming. C\# is object-oriented and has many functional constructs, which presents a viable candidate of Carmack's suggested approach. F\# is a functional programming language and presents a possible candidate for Sweeney's approach. With two programming languages of these paradigms, we can test their applicability to game development. We propose the following research questions to examine the use of functional programming in game development:

\begin{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{How well do experienced game developers express gameplay code in the functional paradigm, in comparison to object-oriented programming?}
        \item How can functional programming be incorporated in game development?
        \item What are the performance impacts of using functional idioms in a game engine?
        \item What is required of functional programming to be adopted by game developers?
    \end{enumerate}
