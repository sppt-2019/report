\chapter{Research}
In this chapter we present the research that was conducted as foundation for the project. We first discuss \gls{FRP}, which is presented as a suitable candidate for integrating functional programming in games\cite{maraffi:frp,courtney2003yampa,cheong2005functional}. Finally we discuss how the usability of programming languages can be ascertained.
