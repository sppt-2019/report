\chapter{Interview Guide}
The interview structure is based on the \textit{scenario-based interview} technique presented in \cite{blackwell2004champagne}. The scenario in this case is the task being solved by the test participant. The interview is conducted during the test itself. The questions asked are open and may be used to lead the participant towards the relevant problem, but not to lead them to answers. The questions should be designed to clarify that the prototype is being tested and not the participant themselves. With this in mind the following questions are posed.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Would you use this tool in a production environment?
  \item Do you understand how (FRP) reactions work?
\end{itemize}
