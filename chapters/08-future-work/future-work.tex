\chapter{Future Work}
In this chapter we outline options for future work. The options fall into three categories; further researching the use of lenient evaluation and if/how it can be adopted in F\#, optimisation of the \gls{FRP} system we developed and alternative usability evaluation methods that can evaluate the use of F\# after the \dquote{initial frustration} that was predominant in our results.
\tmc{MÃ¥ske omformulere denne. Vi har ikke rigtigt snakket om 'initial frustration' tidligere.}

\section{Improving the FRP System}
In this section we discuss how the \gls{FRP} system can be improved in terms of performance. We first outline the performance problems with the current implementation and suggest a refactoring that should improve performance. Afterwards we discuss the possibility of introducing implicit concurrent updates using Unity's C\# Job System.
