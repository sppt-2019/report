\subsection{Unity Concurrency}
The possibility of promising implicit concurrency from using the \gls{FRP} system is indeed appealing. Yampa Arcade has managed to implement a concurrent \gls{FRP} system\cite{courtney2003yampa}. In order for this to be possible we would need to utilise the C\# Job System (which, despite its name should also work in F\#) or \gls{ECS} in Unity. The former allows programmers to implement concurrent code on \ttt{MonoBehaviour}s, whereas the latter uses \ttt{Entity}s rather than \ttt{MonoBehaviour}s. 

The current implementation implements a \ttt{FRPBehaviour}, which inherits from \ttt{MonoBehaviour}. The C\# Job System therefor presents the smallest required change. If we were to implement concurrency using C\# Job System, we would create collections for each event type that holds references to the objects that has subscribed to the event along with the handler they subscribed. In each \ttt{Update} those collections will be mapped in parallel, calling the associated handlers. There are some engineering challenges still, as Unity requires the programmer to manually schedule the jobs and only allows value-types (i.e. \ttt{structs}) to be passed as arguments to a job.
