\section{Reactive Programming in C\#}\label{sec:csharp-rp}
The participants of the usability all agreed that the use of events in gameplay programming would increase code quality compared to Unity's current \m{Update}-strategy. It would therefore be interesting to research if reactive programming would receive a \dquote{warmer welcome} into the game development industry. One possible strategy would be to repeat a similar experiment, but instead of using F\#, a reactive programming system for Unity (such as UniRx\cite{unirx}) would be used. As all tasks in this experiment would be implemented in C\#, it would also have the benefit that the \dquote{initial frustration}, which we discussed earlier in this section, would be entirely removed.
