\section{Longer Term Usability Evaluation}
The usability evaluation presented in this project gives only a small glimpse into the challenges faced by experienced C\# programmers when they start using F\#, more precisely the first 40 minutes. We suspect that part of the reason the programmers were not keen on adopting F\# was that they only experienced the \dquote{initial frustration} of switching to a new language. Another interesting topic to explore is whether the experienced gameplay programmers are more positive towards F\# after gaining more experience. This would require a longer-term usability evaluation to be conducted. 

A longer-term usability evaluation presents the challenge that the programmers may not be monitored all the time, thus decreasing the amount of insight we can obtain on F\#'s learning curve. If we assume that it is not necessary to monitor the participants, we can draw inspiration from the expert-review method presented in \cite{nanz2013examining} and the idea of structuring exercises as game prototypes presented in \tmc{cite til Daniel, Thor og Malte's rapport}. This combined method would formulated a series of game prototype exercises, and send them to participants at regular interval along with a questionnaire that examines how happy the participant was with using F\#. Alternatively several small usability test sessions could be arranged with the participant where he solves similar exercises. Both these approaches require a lot of time from the participant and the latter requires a lot of planning. Nonetheless, these approaches may provide another interesting point-of-view as to why functional programming has not been broadly accepted in the game development industry.
