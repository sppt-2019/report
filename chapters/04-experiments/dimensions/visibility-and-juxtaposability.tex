\subsubsection{Visibility and Juxtaposability}
Visibility and Juxtaposability determines whether required material is accessible without cognitive work\cite{green1996usability}. In textual languages this dimension is not necessarily determined by the language, but more so by the environment (\gls{IDE}).

There are two prominent \glspl{IDE} for the .NET platform: Visual Studio and Rider. Both \glspl{IDE} support numerous ways of making source code available. Examples of such are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Splitting the text editor both horizontally and vertically, such that two files can be open side-by-side
    \item Jumping to implementations by control-clicking. 
    \item Hovering function or type names to read a description of what they're meant for. 
\end{itemize}
