\subsubsection{Viscosity}
Viscosity defines how much effort a developer has to put in to make a small change. \cite{green1996usability} notes that textual languages are less viscous than visual programming languages.

C\# and F\# are both textual languages and thus have relatively low viscosity. We argue that the primary difference between C\# and F\# is scope delimitation. C\# scopes are delimited by pairs of curly brackets, whereas in F\# they are delimited by indentation. If a programmer is to move code from one scope to another in C\#, he would have to either insert or delete pairs of curly brackets, whereas in F\# he would select the code that needs to be moved and press TAB or Shift+TAB.
