\subsubsection{Progressive Evaluation}
Progressive evaluation defines how well a partially finished program can be executed and evaluated. Higher progressive evaluation means that more incomplete programs can be executed. C\# and F\# programs can only be executed if the source code is syntactically correct. We therefore deem that their progressive evaluation is equivalent. Both languages are supported by \gls{REPL}-tools called called C\# Interactive\cite{csharp:interactive} and F\# Interactive\cite{fsharp:interactive} respectively. These tools enable programmers to run and evaluate anything from single lines of code to whole files. We used this tool frequently in the beginning of the project, when we were learning F\# to experiment with different functions and constructs, before implementing them in the source code.
