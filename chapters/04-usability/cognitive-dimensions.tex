\section{Cognitive Dimensions of F\# and C\#}
In order to ascertain the usability of \fs in comparison to \cs, we have conducted an analysis based on the cognitive dimensions framework\cite{green1996usability}. \cs is the gameplay programming language available in the Unity game engine, therefore, if \fs is to usurp this position the advantages and disadvantages should be made clear. We conduct this analysis on the basis of our own experience with \fs. Both authors of this report have prior experience with \cs programming in Unity and no prior experience with \fs.
