\subsubsection{Secondary Notation}
In the test we saw very limited use of secondary notation. This may be caused by the relatively small tasks, along with the fact that the code was not meant to be used in production nor expanded upon. The participants, however, would often open documentation pop-up boxes to read about functions and methods before putting them to use. Generally, our intuition was that the participants had an easier time understanding the C\# documentation than the F\# documentation. We suspect that there two reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The programmers were more experienced in C\#.
    \item F\# uses the arrow-style function signatures (e.g. \fsinline{val map : mapping : ('T -> 'U) -> list:'T list -> 'U list}, which is the signature of \ttt{List.map}) in its documentation. This notation indicates that a function of multiple parameters can be curried. Currying is not supported in C\# and was a concept that most of the participants were unfamiliar with.
\end{enumerate}
